# About
Python is a general purpose programming language. This course covers the basics, linear algebra, plotting, and more to prepare students for solving numerical problems with Python. Python is a viable free and open alternative to MATLAB. Prerequisite: Some intro to programming course or equivalent.

This is a 1 credit hour course that was taught in the [MAE department](http://www.mae.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida during the Fall 2017 semester. There are fourteen 50 minute lectures.

View the [course flyer](PythonProgrammingEML6934.pdf) used for advertising the course within the department.


# Why
During the 2016 academic year I noticed that there were a large number of students wanting to learn Python. Unfortunately for the students, there are limited opportunities at UF to learn and apply Python. To fill this void, I created a 1 credit hour course on Python tailored for graduate students in the MAE department.

# Course material

Lectures were performed using the presentation slides along with a Jupyter Notebook. If you are working through this material on your own, I recommend that you interact with the Jupyter Notebook while following through the lecture slides. Jupyter Notebooks can be launched after installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (with Spyder) or [Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/). Supplementary material, including files necessary to complete the home work, is available in the lecture folders.

# Python Code Editing environment

If you are just starting out with Python, I highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda will include the most popular scientific libraries.  My favorite text editor / IDE for Python is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is free and open source. I have a blog post on how to [setup Code for Python](https://jekel.me/2018/Visual-studio-code-Python-setup/). Code has many wonderful features for working with Python, and will help you write Python code that follows the PEP 8 style guide.
